Project Euler
=============

This project is a collection of my Project Euler solutions in Ruby.

Rake Tasks
----------

Run all the specs, which checks every solution:

    rake spec

Solve a particular problem:

    rake solve p=1

View the elapsed time for a particular solution:

    rake time p=1

Benchmark a particular solution (1,000 iterations):

    rake bm p=1
